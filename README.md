# Reveal Reader
This project was started in 2008 to recreate the wonderful YanCEyWare Reader for Pocket PC on the Android platform.  

It has been moved to GitHub and made available to anyone that is still interested.

The UI is antiquated now because it was developed when Gingerbread (Android 2) was the latest Android version.  

This is provided here with no guarantees that it will work correctly for you.  Please no comments about best practices.  I have moved on ;)
